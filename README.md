# malware-jail
Sandbox for semi-automatic Javascript malware analysis and payload extraction. Written for Node.js

malware-jail is written for [Node's 'vm' sandbox](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html). Currently implements 
WScript (Windows Scripting Host) context [env/wscript.js](https://github.com/HynekPetrak/malware-jail/blob/master/env/wscript.js), at least the part frequently used
by malware. Internet browser context is partialy implemented [env/browser.js](https://github.com/HynekPetrak/malware-jail/blob/master/env/browser.js).

Runs on any operating system, tested on Linux (Node v4.2.1).

## Prerequisites ##

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/).

malware-jail requires [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist), and 
[xmlhttprequest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlhttprequest) and [entities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/entities)
npm packages, you may install them with:

    npm install
    
or 

    nmp install minimist xmlhttprequest entities

## Warning ##

> Be careful when working with a real malware. Malware, that is aware of this sandbox may try to escape it and harm your PC. It's recommended you run it either from an unpriviledged Linux account or from within virtualized Windows machine.

## Usage ##

    bash@linux# node jailme.js -h
    11 Jan 00:07:39 - Malware sandbox ver. 0.2
    11 Jan 00:07:39 - ------------------------
    11 Jan 00:07:39 - Usage: node jailme.js  [[-e file1] [-e file2] .. ] [-o ofile] [-s odir] [--down=y] [malware1 [malware2] .. ]
    11 Jan 00:07:39 -       -e ifile ... js that simulates specific environment
    11 Jan 00:07:39 -       -o ofile ... name of the file where sandbox shall be dumped at the end
    11 Jan 00:07:39 -       -s odir  ... output directory for generated files (malware payload)
    11 Jan 00:07:39 -       --down=y ... use http request to download malware components automatically
    11 Jan 00:07:39 -       malware  ... js with the malware code
    11 Jan 00:07:39 - If no arguments are specified the default values are taken from config.json

In the examples folder you may find a deactivated malware file. Run the analysis with:

    node jailme.js malware/example.js

or just simply:

    node jailme.js
    
Internet browser based malware you may test with

    node jailme.js malware/example_browser.js

The malware/example.js is the default malware file configured in config.json.

After analysis the complete sandbox context is dumped to a file 'sandbox\_dump\_after.json'.
There you may find:

* \_eval\_calls - array of all eval() calls arguments. Useful if eval() is used for deobfucation.
* \_wscript\_saved\_files - content of all files that the malware attempted to drop. The actual files are saved to the output/ directory too.
* \_wscript\_urls - all URLs that the malware intended to GET or POST.
* \_wscript\_objects - WScript or ActiveX objects created.

_'sandbox\_dump\_after.json' uses [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/), implemented by [JSON-js/cycle.js](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js), to save duplicated or cyclic references to a same object.

## Example: Analysing Angler EK ##

Download and extract Angler EK from a pcap file at [ANGLER EK SENDS CRYPTOWALL](http://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2015/12/21/index.html) into a [malware/angler_full.html](https://github.com/HynekPetrak/malware-jail/blob/master/malware/angler_full.html).

Strip the non Angler part and save as [malware/angler_stripped.html](https://github.com/HynekPetrak/malware-jail/blob/master/malware/angler_stripped.html).

Remove `<script>` tags and convert required `<div>` tags into:
    
    document._addElementById(id, content);

and save as [malware/angler.js](https://github.com/HynekPetrak/malware-jail/blob/master/malware/angler.js).

Run the analysis:

    node jailme.js malware/angler.js
    
Eventually capture the output:

    node jailme.js malware/angler.js > angler_log.txt
